## Lessons Learned

While making this project, I learn Java, SQL, HTML, CSS to finish my project. And I also learn about the MVC model and how it work to code. The chanllenges I faced is when to code the comment function. It really hard to show the comment immidiately after you post it and the other account can see it immidiately.
